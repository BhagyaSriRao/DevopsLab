Hello, with that spelling, was used in publications in the U.S. as early as the 18 January 1826 edition of the Norwich Courier of Norwich, Connecticut.[2] Another early use was an 1833 American book called The Sketches and Eccentricities of Col. David Crockett, of West Tennessee,[3] which was reprinted that same year in The London Literary Gazette.[4] The word was extensively used in literature by the 1860s.[5]
